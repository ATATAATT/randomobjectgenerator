# Random Object Generator

Random Object Generator is a free, privacy-friendly web application that provides a suite of creative random generators, including objects, animals, words, and colors. Designed for writers, artists, teachers, students, and game creators, this tool helps spark inspiration, break creative blocks, and simplify decision-making.

## Why Use This Tool?

Creativity often gets stuck in routines, and coming up with new ideas can be challenging. Random Object Generator was created to help anyone—whether you're a writer, artist, teacher, or game designer—find fresh inspiration instantly. By generating random prompts, you can break out of creative blocks, discover new directions, and make brainstorming more fun and effective.

## Project Background

The idea for this tool came from real-world creative work. While preparing for writing sessions, art exercises, and classroom activities, we found that having a simple way to generate random prompts made the process much smoother and more engaging. Existing solutions were either too complex, required registration, or didn't focus on privacy. So, Random Object Generator was built to be fast, free, and privacy-friendly, with no sign-up required and no personal data collected.
